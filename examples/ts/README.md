# TypeScript example

Install:

```
npm install
```

Run tests:

```
TENON_API_KEY=<your key> npm test
```

Note that a Tenon API key is required to run tenon tests. If you don't have
one, those tests will be skipped.

A couple of tests are expected to fail. After tests are run, a report will be
generated in `a11y-report/`.
